					<h2>Here's a timeline of Tesla's life:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span id='bold'>July 10, 1856</span> - Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
							His parents were ethnic Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his
							inventiveness.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1875</span> - Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria.
							He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1882</span> - He went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve
							on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1882</span> - Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle.
							This is used today in alternators.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1884</span> - Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of
							introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1885</span> -After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting
							his own electrical company.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1886</span> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented
							and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1887</span> - The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct
							combpetition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1891</span> - Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced
							a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1891</span> - With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian
							Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1901</span> - Construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over
							long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>August 4, 1915</span> - Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission;
							however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>1934</span> - The New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued
							to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
						<li><span id='bold'>January 7, 1943</span> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S.
							government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>
